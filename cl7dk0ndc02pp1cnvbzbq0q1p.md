## Web Development Series!

HEY DEVELOPERS! This is hritika and I'm curating this series for fellow developers who are willing to learn web development. Basically this series inspired by on going course of web development by ANUJ BHAIYA [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-A-Wxgp5KY](Link)

Here I would be sharing crisp notes from his on going series alongwith his notes and also mine takeaways from the lectures. So lets begin our journey with the very basic question that how actually these websites work?

# What actually websites are?

In simple terms, the website is a collection of webpages. The ‘webpages’ are online pages that you can view by using the internet and web service on a computer or smartphone.

## How does the website work?

Web is the vast collection of digital documents, websites, webpages, media, etc. And you can access them using the web browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.
Basically, the internet and the web are the fundamental technologies on which websites are based.

### Basic terminologies you need to know 

*Website software*  website is made of a set of code or programming languages. The most common programming languages are HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), js (javascript)

*Domain name* In simple terms, the domain name is the name of your website. You need to register your website name with a domain registration company in order to get a unique web address.

*Web hosting* The storage location where your website files and content are stored is called web hosting. 

Lets understand how it works firstly user makes a request from the local machine to fetch IP address from the web server through the web browser which can be easily understand by the illustration below.

Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses henceforth requested IP address would be searched in the DNS server (domain name system).DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

After getting IP address now the response to the requested service would get generated and can be represented with the help of html, css and js and some backend programming language.

Above all three can be used by this nomenclature
