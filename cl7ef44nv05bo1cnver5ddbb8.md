## Web Dev Series : html walkthrough!

HEY DEVELOPERS! Today is day 2 of web development series where we are going to introduced with html which is hyper text markup language.

# DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN  MARKUP  AND  PROGRAMMING  LANGUAGE

Programming language: In simple terms, programming languages are set of instructions or code which tells a computer what it needs to do. So basically, we provide a logic or instruction to the computer to perform some task to get the desired output from it.


Markup Languages: Markup languages are completely different from programming languages. Markup languages prepare a structure for the data or prepare the look or design of a page. These are presentational languages and it doesnâ€™t include any kind of logic or algorithm, for example, HTML.

## BASIC TERMINOLOGIES OF HTML

**HTML ELEMENT**  An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

**< br >** tag defines a line break and is an empty element without a closing tag.

**< h >** tag defines as a heading and it should be used only in the website.

**< p >** tag defines as a paragraph and it can be used multiple times during the website formation.

### ANATOMY OF HTML TAGS 

**1.< p > My cat is grumpy < /p >**

***< p >*** is a opening tag 

***My cat is grumpy is a content*** 

***< /p >*** is a closing tag

**2.< p class ="editor-note" > My cat is grumpy < /p >**

***class ="editor-note"*** is known as attribute. Attributes provide additional information about elements and are always specified in the start tag. Basic syntax goes like this

attribute name= "attribute value" (attribute should be written in doubles quotes its a recommended practice)
