## 100days Of Machine Learning

Hello troubleshooters! This is Hritika ,CSE major budding data engineer and machine learning enthusiast. This series is going to be super interesting as this blog node would be more concentrated towards the core concepts of machine learning and also end to end deployment of machine learning projects rest blog would also cover important and significant algorithms along the journey. So lets begin with the very question what the heck is machine learning is?

Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to LEARN WITH DATA , without being explicitly programmed.

**Basic Difference in ML and Traditional Programming?**

**Traditional Programming:** We feed in DATA (Input) + PROGRAM (logic), run it on the machine, and get the output.

**Machine Learning:** We feed in DATA(Input) + Output, run it on the machine during training and the machine creates its own program(logic), which can be evaluated while testing.

**USECASES OF MACHINE LEARNING**

1. Recommendation system
2. Self driving cars
3. Computer vision in agriculture 
4. Targeted emails and many more fields has its applications.

Above article conveyed the basic introduction of machine learning upcoming blogs would be about digging more about the answering general FAQS. 

**Read till here thanks a bunch!**
