## Web dev series : Head tag in html

# WHAT IS **HEAD** TAG IN HTML?

The < head > tag in HTML is used to define the head portion of the document which contains information related to the document. 

## ELEMENTS < head > contains : 

***1. The < title > tag defines the title of a web page (required). It may be confused with the < h1 > tag, but they are different. The < h1 > tag specifies the title of page content, whereas the < title > tag is metadata representing the title of the entire HTML content and not its content.***

***2. The < style > tag contains CSS code that defines how HTML elements should be rendered in a browser.***

***3. The < base > tag defines an absolute (base) URL for all relative URLs.***

***4. The < link > tag defines the relationship between the current HTML document and the resource to which it refers, or contains a link to an external style sheet. It can have two attributes: rel=" stylesheet " and href.***

***5. The < meta > tag provides additional information (metadata) about HTML document. The < head > of a page can include different kinds of < meta > elements that may contain name and content attributes.***

***6. The < script > tag contains a script (generally JavaScript), or reference to an external file with scripts. This element may not be included in < head >. Sometimes, it is better to put it at the bottom of < body >. The < script > element may seem empty, but it's not.***

***7. The < noscript > tag defines an alternate text, which is displayed, if the browser doesnâ€™t support scripts or scripts are disabled by the user.***
