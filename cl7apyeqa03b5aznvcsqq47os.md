## 100DaysOfCode

Hey coders! This is Hritika tech enthusiast and budding data engineer currently pursuing major in Computer Science and here I'm starting series where I would be sharing mine experience of daily doses of basic building blocks of coding.
So here I'm beginning the very first segment of #100DaysOfCode with the elementary components of #DSAinjava

ðŸ”¹**BASICS OF JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!**

1. Java is general purpose object oriented programming language which allows programmers to create .java file (human readable) which ultimately gets compiled by java compiler into intermediatory .class file (byte code) that in turn gets interpreted by java interpreter into machine code (binary format)

2. **DATA TYPES IN JAVA** 
Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

3. **STATEMENTS IN JAVA** 
Conditional or Selection Statements : (if Statement, if-else statement, if-else-if statement, switch statement)
Loop or Iterative Statements : (for Loop, while Loop, do-while Loop, for-each Loop)
Flow Control or Jump Statements : (return, case, break)  

4. **ARRAYS AND STRINGS IN JAVA** 
An array is a data structure which is a collection of homogeneous elements and widely used to store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. An array of characters works same as Java string. 

5. **FUNCTIONS/METHODS IN JAVA** 
A function is a block of statements that performs a specific task. Functions accept data, process it, and return a result. Functions are written primarily to support the concept of reusability. Once a function is written, it can be called easily without having to write the same code again and again.

6. **TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY** 
The time spent by an algorithm is directly proportional to the execution times of the statements in it. The execution times of the basic operations in the algorithm is the time complexity of the algorithm.
Space complexity is a measure of the amount of storage space temporarily occupied by an algorithm during operation. So space complexity is the number of variables. The calculation rules of spatial complexity are basically similar to the practical complexity, and the large O asymptotic representation is also used.

7. **JAVA COLLECTION FRAMEWORK** 
The Java collections framework provides access to pre-packaged data structures as well as data manipulation methods. A collection is a type of object that may keep track of other things by storing references to them. And the operations that can be performed on each type of collection are defined by the collection interfaces.

8. **NO POINTERS IN JAVA WHY IS IT SO?**
To make java secure it doesnâ€™t support pointers. Pointers can be used to allocate and deallocate memory. This is good feature of pointers but sometimes it requires arbitrary efforts from programmers eventually as java provides the automatic garbage collection feature so there is no need of pointers and it makes memory management easier.

9. **OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN JAVA** 
Class ,Object , Method and method passing , Pillars of OOPs :Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

10. **DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IN JAVA** 

   LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES : (Linked List, Stacks, Queues)

   HIERARCHICAL DATA STRUCTURES : (Binary Trees, Heaps, Hash Tables)

   SORTING ALGORITHMS : (Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Heap sort, Quick Sort, Merge 
   sort, Shell Sort , Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, Radix sort)

   SEARCHING ALGORITHMS : (Linear Search Algorithm, Binary Search Algorithm , Interpolation Search 
   Algorithm).
